# Spatio-Temporal-Demand-Forecasting-for-Bike-Sharing-Systems
Jupyter notebooks and experiments for spatio-temporal demand forecasting in bike-sharing systems. Includes data prep, visualization, and ML modeling.

This project implements spatio-temporal demand forecasting for bike-sharing systems using PySpark, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualization libraries. It is organized into three Jupyter notebooks: (1) Data Preparation (SafePedalSF_1_DataPrep.ipynb) covering dataset loading, cleaning, and spatial utilities (Haversine distance, addressâ€“coordinate conversions); (2) Visualization (SafePedalSF_2_Visualization_Clean.ipynb) presenting exploratory data analysis with trends, distributions, and correlations (plots can be re-run locally since large embedded images were removed); and (3) Modeling (SafePedalSF_3_Modeling.ipynb) detailing feature engineering, prediction pipeline construction, and machine learning experiments with Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees, followed by evaluation and insights. Together, these notebooks provide a complete workflow from raw data to predictive modeling of bike-sharing demand.
